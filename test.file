The contents of this file change as needed, to allow a push.

Edit 1: This file should appear on the server without having to pull manually.
Edit 2: Added a log to the hook, seeing if THAT appears remotely.
Edit 3: I tried renaming the hook from post-receive to post-update.
Edit 4: Trying `unset GIT_DIR` advice.
Edit 5: The hook runs fine when run from the server CLI. Trying again.
